Python Code Generator
The Python Code Generator is a tool that generates Python code based on user input or specifications. It automates repetitive coding tasks, creates boilerplate code, and generates entire programs.

Key Features
1. Code Generation: Generates Python code based on user input, such as function or class definitions, data structures, or algorithms.
2. Customization: Users can customize generated code to fit their needs, including adding or removing features, modifying variable names, or adjusting indentation.
3. Error Handling: Includes error handling mechanisms to ensure generated code is robust and reliable.

Use Cases
1. Rapid Prototyping: Quickly generates code for prototypes or proof-of-concepts.
2. Code Optimization: Optimizes existing code by generating more efficient or effective versions.
3. Education and Training: Helps students learn Python programming concepts and best practices.

Benefits
1. Increased Productivity: Saves time and effort by automating repetitive coding tasks.
2. Improved Accuracy: Reduces errors and improves code quality through automated generation.
3. Enhanced Learning: Facilitates learning and understanding of Python programming concepts.
